Define a class Graph that should model a Graph data structure and store its adjacency matrix, 
and have default (adjacency matrix should be a null matrix) as well as parameterized constructors. 
Graph class also has two method display() that displays the adjacency matrix, and isConnected() 
as predicate method that checks whether given graph is connected or not. Create two another classes 
namely DirectedGraph and WeightedGraph, both inherits Graph. DirectedGraph has two methods indegree() 
and outdegree() that calculates and indegree and outdegree of each node in the DirectedGraph. 
Similarly, WeightedGraph has a method shortestPath() that finds the shortest path between two 
given nodes using any of the algorithm known to you.Write a Test program to demonstrate the working 
of all the three classes in your main program.
